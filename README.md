# California Fatal Encounters Data
This is a list of fatal encounter victims which all died as a result of interaction with California law enforcement agencies. This particular set of data only includes records for Afician Americans.

These are incident and victim datasets that document African Americans killed through encounters with police. We started with the data collected and shared on the Fatalencounters.org website. We added webarchive links to the websites that document these incidents. The webarchive links are available thanks to [Archive.org's Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/).
